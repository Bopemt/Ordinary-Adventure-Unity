# Unity_First_Game
This is my first Unity project. It's 2D Top-Down game.

Now, in this game you can go home, go down to the dungeon, kill monsters, shoot from the bow, interact with treasure chests and signs. The key to open the door to the next dungeon room is kept in one of the chests. There are doors and statues in the dungeon, which are activated by switches on the floor. There is also a room in the dungeon where you have to kill all the monsters to leave the room.

The game is automatically saved when you exit the game and automatically downloads the save when you enter the game.

Soon, I'm going to add a system of quests and levels, player inventory, and complete the save system.
