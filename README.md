# Unity_First_Game
This is my first Unity project. It's 2D Top-Down game.

Now, in this game you can go home, go down to the dungeon, kill monsters, shoot from the bow, interact with shop, quest board, treasure chests and signs. The key to open the door to the next dungeon room is kept in one of the chests. There are doors and statues in the dungeon, which are activated by switches on the floor. There is also a room in the dungeon where you have to kill all the monsters to leave the room.

WASD - move
SHIFT - dash
TAB - inventory (To equip item in a quick access slot, select item and press 1-6 on top of keyboard. To open the dungeon door, come close to door, open the inventory and use the key)
Q - hide/show quick access slot
E - interact
SPACE - attack
J - journal
ESC - pause (after press load press ESC twice. This bug will be fixed later
F5 - quick save
F6 - quick load
